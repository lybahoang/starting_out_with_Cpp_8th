/**
    The program demonstrates a recursive method to determine the width of a tree.
    The method involves two functions:
        1. The getLevelWidth method returns the width of the current level of a tree.
        2. The getTreeWidth method returns the width of a tree.
    The pseudocode of the algorithm:
        1. Initialize treeWidth to 0.
        2. Get the height of the tree
